## Description

This application creates and saves notes. When you open the application you are presented with a landing page and a link to the notes page. The notes page includes a list of existing notes on the left-hand side, and spaces to enter new notes on the right hand side. When you enter a new note's title and text a save button appears. When a note is saved it appears in the existing notes section. When you click on the write icon, you are presented with new empty fields to enter another and save a new note.

The file works through Express.js on the backend. It stores notes with unique IDs in a JSON file.
